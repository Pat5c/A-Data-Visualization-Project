# KEEPING IN TOUCH WITH LOVED ONES, DURING A PANDEMIC

2020 has been by far the most challenging year for most people, on so many levels: COVID-19 and the lockdowns 
linked to it, have been the major events.
On media and newspapers, we always hear about experts advising people in isolation, to keep in contact with loved 
ones, in order to reduce the loneliness related to the situation.
The motivation behind this research, stands in my curiosity in understanding how people keep in touch with loved 
ones around the world, with which frequency they communicate and how COVID-19 related lockdowns has affected 
these habits.

The research questions are:

a. How (with which methods and tools/apps) have participants kept in touch with loved ones (family or friends)
who do not live in the same household of the participants, during Coronavirus-linked lockdowns?

b. How often and for how long (in average) do participants communicate with loved ones during Coronaviruslinked lockdowns, in respect to earlier times?

c. How the contact with loved ones (or lack of it) affects participants' mood, during Covid-19 linked lockdowns.

The objectives and scope of this research are: collecting data and providing insights in regards to the methods and 
tools (apps or in phone tools) used by people to keep in touch with loved ones, during Coronavirus-linked lockdowns. 
To analyse the frequency and duration of contact with loved and investigate if contact has increased, decreased or 
remained the same during Coronavirus-linked lockdowns, in respect to non-COVID-19 times. Finally, the research will
also provide an insight on how the contact with loved ones (or lack of it) affects participants' mood.

The population for this survey is anyone above the age of 18, able to understand English, who has experienced a Covid19 linked lockdown and has family or friends, who do not live in their same household (or country).
The sample chosen will be my peer students at the University of London, together with colleagues, family and friends
(over 18, able to understand English) who has lived a Covid-19 linked lockdown and has family or friends who do not
live in their same household (or country).

As stated above, with the term “loved ones” I am referring to (family or friends) who do not live in the same household 
of the participants.

With the term “COVID-19” or “Coronavirus pandemic” I am referring to “a contagious disease caused by severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 … identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, which has since spread 
worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.” Wikipedia Contributors (2020)
With the term “Coronavirus-linked lockdown” or only “lockdown” I am referring to partial (to specific areas only) or 
total (for the whole country) government-imposed emergency protocol that prevents people from leaving the area, 
to reduce the numbers of contagion caused by the virus COVID-19.
With the term “Methods of contact”, within this report, I am referring to the different ways people living away from 
each other, communicate (the options within the Survey will be Message, Voice message, Call, Video call or Letter).
“Participants” are individuals, within the sample, who are taking part into this survey.

The survey is made up of 14 questions - please, refer to Appendix A for a complete survey questions PDF with
introduction and list of choices.
The first 3 questions are meant to gain more information on participants by identifying gender, age and country they 
live in.

Because the survey is meant to capture the changes in contacting loved ones, due to Covid-19 related lockdowns, 
survey question number 4 aim, isto confirm that all participants have had governments imposing a Coronavirus-linked 
lockdown. Question 7, will double check that also loved ones are from countries where governments did impose 
lockdowns.

Multiple choice questions number 5 and 6 aim to investigate in order, with which methods participants contact these 
family or friends and with which tools or technologies. For both questions, I will be also providing the “Other” option,
to allow open-ended answers. The analysis of these questions, will provide an answer to research question a.
Likert scale question 8 will establish participants’ views on contact changes during COVID-19 related lockdowns.
Questions 9 and 10 focus on gathering more information on contact habits prior to the pandemic and lockdowns: the 
first investigates the frequency participants would keep in touch with loved ones; the latter investigates the length of 
conversations or exchanges with loved ones.

Next, I will be investigating these same habits, but during COVID-19 linked lockdowns, with question 11 and 12.
Question 9 will be analysed against question 11 and question 10 with question 12 (they offer the same measuring 
scale).

All of the questions from 8 to 12 will provide good data in answering research question b.
Lastly, questions 13 and 14 are meant to investigate the effects on participants’ mood when keeping in touch with 
loved ones or not keeping in touch with them, during COVID-19-linked lockdowns.
These questions will provide good data to answer research question c.

# ANALYSIS

The survey has been undertaken by 50 participants, within the sample.
The analysis will go thorough each of the 14 questions, a brief description is to be found under each visualisation with 
the outcome of the analysis. For nominal variables, a mode will be calculated whenever possible.
Here it is the age and gender detail.

<img width="542" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Pat5c/Data-Viz/assets/124057584/dfeadf3c-6234-4763-b598-f18530d87116">

Next, I am going to explore where our participants are living.

<img width="529" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Pat5c/Data-Viz/assets/124057584/d9995dc6-b3d9-41fe-ab5a-2e48f82653e8">

Now, I am going to analyse question 4 of the survey, with the pie chart below: all of the participants have experienced 
a Coronavirus-linked lockdown.

<img width="221" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Pat5c/Data-Viz/assets/124057584/744f74bf-ccf1-4dc0-9a74-89ed56e7335e">

Now that I've analysed and identified my sample's main demographics characteristics, I'll proceed to analyse which 
are the preferred methods of contact of participants with their loved ones, during Coronavirus-linked lockdown.

<img width="302" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Pat5c/Data-Viz/assets/124057584/4e89a36f-6088-4f04-9641-ecca1ea6bc60">

From the bar graph above, we can determine that the preferred method of contact of participants is through a Call to 
loved ones (which is also the mode), followed by Video Call, Message and Voice message. Letter, is the least preferred 
Method.
Interesting, will be to analyse how these choices have been, depending to the age group participants are from.

<img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Pat5c/Data-Viz/assets/124057584/7340cc16-594c-41e1-aa46-18186c87f334">

This same analysis is going to be applied to the preferred apps, people use to keep in touch with loved ones, during 
Coronavirus-linked lockdown.

<img width="454" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Pat5c/Data-Viz/assets/124057584/596173e8-bca8-4b8b-976e-91a8f430cbc7">

WhatsApp is the preferred App for participants to keep in touch with loved ones (it is also the mode). Followed by 
Facebook Messenger, Zoom, Face Time and Skype.
The least chosen apps are Slack and Google Hangouts. Participants seem to prefer apps to built-in phone/iPhone tools.

<img width="317" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Pat5c/Data-Viz/assets/124057584/904f3e8a-0ab0-400f-a5fd-bf88e87fd11a">

<img width="314" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Pat5c/Data-Viz/assets/124057584/12abf3a4-8caa-49b7-b742-661136d414e5">

The stacked bar chart above, shows that age group 25-34 is the one which choose WhatsApp the most and is also the 
one which uses all of the apps above.
Age group 18-24 prefers all of the apps above, except for Slack, Teams and Hangouts. The older age groups 45-54, 55-
64, 65-74 seem to be choosing less options: the latter, WhatsApp only, 45-54 (Zoom, Skype and WhatsApp) while 55-
64 WhatsApp and Messenger only.
I want to have a look at the open question in the Other selection option to this question (6):

<img width="116" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Pat5c/Data-Viz/assets/124057584/1299f7a4-66df-468f-b83f-ace3a43d6054">

Among the given choices, participants use 2 other Apps: Telegram and Duo.

Now, I want to quickly have a look at where participants’ loved ones are based around the world. The histogram below 
shows the information. 

<img width="531" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Pat5c/Data-Viz/assets/124057584/c666d862-8b9e-41d7-96ea-ce751dad5981">

The mode is Italy, even if we can spot that the United Kingdom has the same frequency value as for Italy. These are 
followed by Ghana, India and Canada.

Now, I am going to examine the levels of agreement of Likert scale survey question 8.

<img width="529" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Pat5c/Data-Viz/assets/124057584/567b9d65-ba80-4921-b368-3cc70f965296">

The majority of participants agrees with the fact that, during Coronavirus-linked lockdowns, they have increased 
contact with loved ones, as shown by the orange 18% and pink 44% bars.
20% of participants are indifferent with the statement and 18% disagree with it. No participants strongly disagree with 
the statement.

Now, I am going to cross check the information provided in survey questions 9 and 11 to evaluate how often 
participants would keep in touch with their loved ones, PRIOR to the Covid-19 pandemic and how this has changed, 
during Coronavirus-linked lockdowns.

<img width="525" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Pat5c/Data-Viz/assets/124057584/a006b4ff-c4a4-4e86-8164-4efa687c321a">

As per the heat map above, 46% of participants have said that they've contacted their loved ones, every day during 
COVID-19 related lockdowns, while prior to the pandemic only 26% of participants would contact them every day.
Prior to the pandemic, participants frequency of contact is well distributed within the first five options (every day 26%, 
every other day 20%, three times per week 10%, twice per week 14% and once per week 18%).

The next evaluation will be to examine the exchanges durations with loved ones, prior versus during COVID-19 related 
lockdowns.

<img width="539" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Pat5c/Data-Viz/assets/124057584/cccd7560-7609-45c0-851a-70c48bf7734c">

The diverging stacked bar char, shows that, while 15 minutes or less exchanges are among the most chosen duration 
times by participants pre-COVID-19 times; during COVID-19 related lockdowns, the bar related to this value shortens, 
to give space to the other values.
Exchanges for 1 hour are among the most chosen by participants during lockdowns (16%), compared to pre-COVID-19
values (6%). The same situation is registered for exchanges for half an hour (during 30%, pre 28%) and 2 hours (during 
4%, pre 2%).

I am now going to analyse the survey Likert scale question 13 which measures the levels of agreement to the question:

<img width="533" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Pat5c/Data-Viz/assets/124057584/012d5c0e-4766-4593-a991-447c09bec604">

The majority of participants (36% + 46%) strongly agrees and agrees with the sentence, while 16% is indifferent and a 
little over 3% disagrees with the statement.

Lastly, I’ll work out the level of happiness when participants do not contact their loved ones, for a relatively longer 
period of 2 weeks, during COVID-19-linked lockdowns.

<img width="532" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Pat5c/Data-Viz/assets/124057584/92e7c61e-7f85-4a35-bde2-fe5facb632d8">

The vertical diverging stacked bar char, shows that the percentage of participants who are generally unhappy when 
not contacting loved ones for more than 2 weeks, during COVID-19-linked lockdowns, are the majority (76% of 
participants). While a very little percentage (2%) are extremely happy to not contacting loved once for more than 2 
weeks and around 22% participants are neutral to this event.

# CONCLUSION

To summarize, during Covid-19 related lockdowns, participants seem to prefer Calls as method of contact for loved 
ones. And the main app used is WhatsApp.
The majority of participants agree with the fact that, during Coronavirus-linked lockdowns, they have increased 
contact with their loved ones: in fact, 46% of participants has said that they've contacted their loved ones every day 
during COVID-19-lockdowns, against 26% of participants who would do so prior to the lockdowns.
Moreover, the length of exchanges and conversations has increased during lockdowns: exchanges for 1 hour, for 
example, have been chosen the most by participants (16%), compared to pre-COVID-19 numbers (6%).
Lastly, the majority of participants (82%) agrees that keeping in touch with loved ones, during COVID-19-linked 
lockdowns, improves their mood. And when not hearing from family or friends, for more than 2 weeks, participants
are generally unhappy (around 70%).

# DISCUSSION

“As of September 2020, the only countries which have not imposed a Coronavirus-linked lockdown are Sweden, 
Taiwan, Japan and South Korea”. Wikipedia Contributors (2020)
In the event that both participants and loved ones are in fact from these countries with non-imposed lockdown, the 
survey will be inaccurate as one of the requirements to be able to complete the survey, will not be met (not the case 
with the survey’s responses).
A point of weakness of the survey, it that there are not enough participants for every age groups, to make a precise 
and realistic confrontation.
Furthermore, Likert scales survey questions may acquiescence response bias and push participants towards agreement 
responses.
Lastly, as the survey is designed to involve as many participants as possible, the definition of loved ones was not 
narrowed only to family members: by providing the “or friend” option, I wanted to make the survey the most 
accessible as possible. I took into consideration participants who may not have close family or are already living with 
their families, for example. Due to this fact, results may not be as narrowed and precise as desired.
